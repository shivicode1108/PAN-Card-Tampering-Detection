In This project,we will Detect Tampering of pan card using computer vision. This project will help the different organizations in detecting whether the ID i.e. The pan card providedto them by their employess or customers or anyone is original or not.

#Functionality
1) Get images from user.<br>
2)Check for size and format of the image.<br>

5)Find the similarity indiex of the images.<br>
6)Finding the threshold of the image.<br>
7)Finding contour and grab those contour using imutils.<br>
8)Draw a bounding rectangle using these contours.<br>
9)Plot Differences,Threshold,Original and Tampered image.<br>
10)Compare all the images and check the similarity score to decide tampering.<br>
